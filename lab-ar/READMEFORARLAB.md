Lab 2: AR Lab

One potential app concept that could be built from the foundations of the prototype 
we did in class could be an AR app that renders kids toys onto the screen. The app
would essentially be a way for a parent to bring a miniature playset along to keep
their child entertained, say, while waiting at the doctor's office.

The app would include objects like letter blocks, which could be rearranged and rotated 
around to make different words or configurations by placing on flat surfaces the phone's
camera sees; or a model train that moves around, and the child watches and can interact 
with by following it with the camera as it chugs around.
